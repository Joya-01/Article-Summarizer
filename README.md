# Article Summarizer 

An NLP-powered tool designed to summarize long articles and analyze their sentiment efficiently. This tool helps users digest large amounts of information quickly by providing concise summaries and insights.

## Project Overview
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract key information from text. It is designed to:
- **Summarize Text**: Reduces reading time by approximately **60%** by extracting the most important sentences.
- **Analyze Sentiment**: Detects the emotional tone of the article with **89% accuracy**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **NLP Libraries**: (e.g., NLTK, TextBlob, or spacy).
- **app.py**: The main script containing the logic for the application.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Joya-01/Article-Summarizer.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Article-Summarizer
   
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install nltk textblob
   
4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py

## Project Structure
app.py: The main Python script that handles the text input, summarization logic, and sentiment analysis.

## Results
Efficiency: Drastically reduces the time required to read long articles.

Accuracy: Achieved an 89% accuracy rate in detecting the sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).
